				<h2>We are Taking Small Steps to Make Earth Better Planet of the universe</h2>
				<p>We welcome you with great joy to the Word Liberation Ministry Church.
					We are here to share the great news of Jesus Christ to all that will listen.<br>
					The church has historically been involved in liberation movements, advocating for the freedom and dignity of oppressed peoples.
					Liberation theology, for instance, emerged in the 20th century, emphasizing the liberation of the poor and marginalized as central 
					to Christian faith. It underscores the church''s role in addressing social injustices, economic inequalities, and systemic oppression. 
					Through its teachings and actions, the church seeks to empower individuals and communities to break free from bondage and experience liberation in all its forms – spiritual, social, and economic.</p>

    				Amen.
					The Bible emphasizes the importance of prayer as a means of communication with God. In Philippians 4:6-7, it says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it."
